# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my personal take on **[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)**! 🚀 This year, I’m solving the daily programming challenges in **Python**. Below, you’ll find my progress, structure, and details about the project.

## 🎯 About Advent of Code
Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual series of programming puzzles that are released daily from December 1st to December 25th. It’s a fantastic opportunity to improve problem-solving skills, explore new algorithms, and have fun with coding during the festive season!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python (version 3.13)
- **Dependency Management**: [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- **Libraries**: I aim to use as many additional libraries as available, to explore the richness of the python ecosystem

## 📁 Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
📂 advent-of-code-2024
├── 📂 day01
│ ├── input.txt # Puzzle input for Day 1
│ ├── solution.py # Combined solution for Day 1
├── 📂 day02
│ ├── input.txt # Puzzle input for Day 2
│ ├── solution.py # Combined solution for Day 2
├── poetry.lock # Poetry lockfile for dependency management
├── pyproject.toml # Project configuration and dependencies
├── README.md # Project documentation
└── utils.py # Helper functions used across days
```

- Each day will have its own folder for better organization.
- Solutions for each part will typically be in the same file.
- **Input files** will be stored in `input.txt`.

## 🎄 Daily Progress
| Day   | Part 1 | Part 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Day 1 | ✅ Done | ✅ Done |
| Day 1 | ✅ Done | ✅ Done |
| Day 3 | ✅ Done | ✅ Done |

I’ll update this table daily as I progress.

## 🚀 Running the Code
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeroenoldenburger/advent-of-code.git
   cd advent-of-code/2024
   ```
2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
    ```bash
   poetry install
    ```
3. Run a specific solution:
    ```bash
    poetry run python day01/solution.py
    ```

🔧 Utilities
Reusable helper functions (e.g., input parsing, benchmarking) are located in utils.py.

---

💡 My Goals for AoC 2024
Solve each puzzle on the day it’s released (if possible).
Write clean, modular code that’s easy to read and reuse.
Document thought processes and lessons learned for tricky puzzles.
